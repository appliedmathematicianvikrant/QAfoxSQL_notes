# When SQL stataemnty is loengthy then reading such statements will become hard 
# select customerID, customerName, country, city  from customers  where country='France' limit 3;
# it is not easy to understand this statement
# write it as
# select customerID, customerName, country, city  
# from customers 
# where country='France'
# limit 3;

                                                part 18  Built in functions and there categories

# Different RDBMS softwares 
# MySQL, Oracle,  different RDBMS softwares has there own list of built in functions
# we are using built in functions of MySQL
# just go to google.com and search for MySQL functions
# Types of builts in functions
# 1. DAte and Time function
# 2. string function
# 3. Aggregate fujnction
# 4.numeric function

                                                  part 19   UPPER()  string function

#Purpose: To convert the text under the table column to upper case
# select 'Arun Motori'    its output is Arun Motori
# But if we apply UPPER function
# select UPPER('Arun Motori');  output is   ARUN MOTORI
# select UPPER(column_name) from tanle_name;  will give all column data in capitals.
#

                                                   part 20  LOWER() string function

# Purpose: to convert the text under the column name to lower case
# select 'Arun Motori'    its output is   Arun Motori
# if we apply lower function  
# select LOWER('Arun Motori');    Its output is   arun motori
# select LOWER(column_name) AS countryfrom table_name;  will give all column data in lower case.
# if we do not use alias then the column will be shown as LOWER(column_name)  whiuch does not looks good
#
                                  part 21  length() string function
purpose: find the length/size of the data under the specified column name
we can also apply this function on some string
select length('Arun motori');     remember that a space is alos counted as one
select length(column_name) as our_choose_name from table_name;

we can also use this function with WHERE clause  exampel WHERE length(column_name) = 6

                                  part 22   INSTR() string function  
purpose: to find the positoin of gievn text in the data of the specified column
INSTR(column_name, 'u')

it can also be used without columns
select instr('Vikrant', 'a');   output: 5
it is better to use some alias 
if some string is not present the  the outout is 0
        
                                          part 23  substr()  string function
 purpose: to find the portion of of text from the data of the specified column
 SELECT SUBSTR(column_name, starting_position , number of digits we want after starting position)    string strts with index 1
  SELECT SUBSTR('Arun Motoori', 2,3)    output :   run
  we can also use negative index
   SELECT SUBSTR('Arun Motoori', -3,2)    output :   or
   
   we can also aply this to column_namae 
   SELECT SUBSTR(column_name, starting_index,number_of_strings_required ) 
   
   
   
                                      part 24  CONCAT()  function
   MySQL function which falls under string categroy function
   Purpose: To addd two or more column data together
   CONCAT(first_column, ' ', last_column)
   
   WE can also print some conated strings
   CONCAT('Hello', 'World')   Output:  HelloWorld
   
                                      part 25 TRIM()  function
 
it falls under string category
purpose: to remove the leading and trailing spaces in the column data
SELECT TRIM('  Vikrant    ');
It will remove the spaces


we can also compose these functions as the logics permits.



                                             Part 34  Arithmetic Operators
                                             
Addition +
Subtraction  -
Multiplication *

select 5 + 4;    Output : 9

SELECT Price AS original_Price, Price + 10 AS modified_price from Products;


                                           part 35   How to install mySQL servers

   
                                            part 36  Creating ,deleting, viewing adn using database
                                            
               Databses and schema are intercahngable words
               
               first we see what databases are already present in our server 
               SHOW DATABASES;
               
               Now we create a new database 
               CREATE DATABASE data_base_name;
               
               Now if want to delete this database , we use
               
               DROP DATABASE data_base_name;
               
               Before using any table name , we have to select the database so that server can know
               
               USE data_base_name;   noiw this data base is selected.
                                            
                                            
                                  Part 37           
                                            
  Table is one of the objects in a databses
  it has tables , views, functions, procedure
  
  syntax to see all tables in a database
  show tables;  will show all the tables in  aprticul;ar database once thta database is choose
  
  syntax to craete a table
  CREATE TABLE table_name(id int, name varchar(15),experience int);
  
 DESCRIBE table_name;  this syntax gives all details of this table  name of fields, its datatype and all such details 
 are obtained by this clause
 
 
 WE can alos use alias as follows
 
 Suppse we have a tablew as follows
   CREATE TABLE employees(id int, name varchar(15),experience int);
   
   Now we can also make another table using some columsn from this table as folows
   create table emp as
   select id, name from employees;                This is the method to create new table based on exdisting table.
   
   
   Now we see how to delete a table
   
   DROP TABLE table_name;
                                                              
                                                              Part 38   Inserting data into tables
        
  INSERT INTO table_name 
                 VALUES(1, 'arun', 12 );      
   Once we run this mquery this data is inserted into the given table                                                          
             If we provide only 2 values then it will give an error.
  Now if we want to insert only these two values and rest we want NULL then  we have to write it as follows
    INSERT INTO table_name (column_name1, column_name 2)
                 VALUES( 'arun', 12 ); 
         Here the column_name is for those  column  i which we want to insert the values
