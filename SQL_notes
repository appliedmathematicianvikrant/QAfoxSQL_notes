-- What is a databse
# it is a place where we can store and the data from.
# we can enter te data into databse.alter
# what is databse managemet system:
#  it is a software which is used to access the data in our databse.
# example of DBMS from our market MangoDB, Cassandra etc
# What is Data model?
# It defines how the data is stored insde a database.
# DBMS softwares can use nay of the model like
# 1. Hierarchcical    Parent child type of relationship
# 2.Network model    one child can have more than one parent
# 3.Entity relational model  one entity has many atrinutes.
# 4.relational model  it uses tables 

 
                                              Part 3

#SELECT Command in SQL
#It is used o retrieve the data from the table.
#Syntax:  select * from table_name;
# means all columns from the given table _name
# Now if we do not want all columns 
#  Use syntax:
 # SELECT column1, column2
# from table_name;

                                             Part 4

#To retrive unique values from particular column
# SELECT DISTINCT  column_name
# FROM table_name;
#
# if we  use distinct keyword before more than on columns then 
# if there are same value in fitst column but corresponding theynhave different va;ues
# in second column then these same values will be displayed

                                               part 5

# sql is not case sensitive langauge
# All clauses can be written in upper or lower or in mixed alphabets.

                                               part 6
# importance of semicolon " ; "
# select * from customers;  we eend the satement with semicolon 
# is it mandatory . Only in some RDBMS software it is mandatory
# in Mysql it is optional.
#  
# What is the purpose of semicolon?
#  we want to excutes more than one statment so the semicolon indicates that now we have end of
# a query.It seperators multiple sql statements.

                                               part 7     WHERE clause
# used in select statement
# we will be able to filter some data based on some condition
# Example:
# select * from customers where city='London';
#  as country name is text we have used single quotes
#  Numbers are not surrounded by single quotes.
# Here we have used the '=' operators but we can use other operators also.

                                                 part 8  Relational operators in WHERE clause
 
#  We ecan use the following relational opeartors
#  =  equal opeator
#  > greater than opeator
#  < less than operator
#  >=  greater than or equal to opeator 
# <= less than or equal to operator
# <>  or !=  not equal to
# Example : select * from orders where price <= 40;

                                                  part 9   logical operators
# used with WHERE clause conditions
#                      Withot logical opeators                  with logical operators   AND, OR, NOT
#         filter the data Only one condition is taken                 more than one condition can be taken to flter the data 
#                                                                 select * from table_name where condition1 AND condition2..
#   Example to use NOT 
# select * from table_name where NOT city='Germany';   NOT do reverse filteration.

# part 10

                                                part 17 breaking lengthy sql queries  into multiple lines

# When SQL stataemnty is loengthy then reading such statements will become hard 
# select customerID, customerName, country, city  from customers  where country='France' limit 3;
# it is not easy to understand this statement
# write it as
# select customerID, customerName, country, city  
# from customers 
# where country='France'
# limit 3;

                                                part 18  Built in functions and there categories

# Different RDBMS softwares 
# MySQL, Oracle,  different RDBMS softwares has there own list of built in functions
# we are using built in functions of MySQL
# just go to google.com and search for MySQL functions
# Types of builts in functions
# 1. DAte and Time function
# 2. string function
# 3. Aggregate fujnction
# 4.numeric function

                                                  part 19   UPPER()  string function

#Purpose: To convert the text under the table column to upper case
# select 'Arun Motori'    its output is Arun Motori
# But if we apply UPPER function
# select UPPER('Arun Motori');  output is   ARUN MOTORI
# select UPPER(column_name) from tanle_name;  will give all column data in capitals.
#

                                                   part 20  LOWER() string function

# Purpose: to convert the text under the column name to lower case
# select 'Arun Motori'    its output is   Arun Motori
# if we apply lower function  
# select LOWER('Arun Motori');    Its output is   arun motori
# select LOWER(column_name) AS countryfrom table_name;  will give all column data in lower case.
# if we do not use alias then the column will be shown as LOWER(column_name)  whiuch does not looks good
#
                                  part 21  length() string function
purpose: find the length/size of the data under the specified column name
we can also apply this function on some string
select length('Arun motori');     remember that a space is alos counted as one
select length(column_name) as our_choose_name from table_name;

we can also use this function with WHERE clause  exampel WHERE length(column_name) = 6

                                  part 22   INSTR() string function  
purpose: to find the positoin of gievn text in the data of the specified column
INSTR(column_name, 'u')

it can also be used without columns
select instr('Vikrant', 'a');   output: 5
it is better to use some alias 
if some string is not present the  the outout is 0
        
                                          part 23  substr()  string function
 purpose: to find the portion of of text from the data of the specified column
 SELECT SUBSTR(column_name, starting_position , number of digits we want after starting position)    string strts with index 1
  SELECT SUBSTR('Arun Motoori', 2,3)    output :   run
  we can also use negative index
   SELECT SUBSTR('Arun Motoori', -3,2)    output :   or
   
   we can also aply this to column_namae 
   SELECT SUBSTR(column_name, starting_index,number_of_strings_required ) 
   
   
   
                                      part 24  CONCAT()  function
   MySQL function which falls under string categroy function
   Purpose: To addd two or more column data together
   CONCAT(first_column, ' ', last_column)
   
   WE can also print some conated strings
   CONCAT('Hello', 'World')   Output:  HelloWorld
   
                                      part 25 TRIM()  function
 
it falls under string category
purpose: to remove the leading and trailing spaces in the column data
SELECT TRIM('  Vikrant    ');
It will remove the spaces


we can also compose these functions as the logics permits.

select 5 + 4;    Output : 9

SELECT Price AS original_Price, Price + 10 AS modified_price from Products;


                                           part 35   How to install mySQL servers

   
                                            part 36  Creating ,deleting, viewing adn using database
                                            
               Databses and schema are intercahngable words
               
               first we see what databases are already present in our server 
               SHOW DATABASES;
               
               Now we create a new database 
               CREATE DATABASE data_base_name;
               
               Now if want to delete this database , we use
               
               DROP DATABASE data_base_name;
               
               Before using any table name , we have to select the database so that server can know
               
               USE data_base_name;   noiw this data base is selected.
                                            
                                            
                                  Part 37           
                                            
  Table is one of the objects in a databses
  it has tables , views, functions, procedure
  
  syntax to see all tables in a database
  show tables;  will show all the tables in  aprticul;ar database once thta database is choose
  
  syntax to craete a table
  CREATE TABLE table_name(id int, name varchar(15),experience int);
  
 DESCRIBE table_name;  this syntax gives all details of this table  name of fields, its datatype and all such details 
 are obtained by this clause
 
 
 WE can alos use alias as follows
 
 Suppse we have a tablew as follows
   CREATE TABLE employees(id int, name varchar(15),experience int);
   
   Now we can also make another table using some columsn from this table as folows
   create table emp as
   select id, name from employees;                This is the method to create new table based on exdisting table.
   
   
   Now we see how to delete a table
   
   DROP TABLE table_name;
                                                              
                                                              Part 38   Inserting data into tables
        
  INSERT INTO table_name 
                 VALUES(1, 'arun', 12 );      
   Once we run this mquery this data is inserted into the given table                                                          
             If we provide only 2 values then it will give an error.
  Now if we want to insert only these two values and rest we want NULL then  we have to write it as follows
    INSERT INTO table_name (column_name1, column_name 2)
                 VALUES( 'arun', 12 ); 
         Here the column_name is for those  column  i which we want to insert the values                                                    
                                                             
                                                             
                                                             Part 39  Data types
                                                             
Each and every column of a table need to have a name and a data type
This is required when we create a table 
create table employees(id int, name varchar(), experience int)

There are following three major data types in MySQL
1.String
2.Numeric
3.dat and time

For string varchar is most widely used although many types are given 
int, double, boolean we study for numeric 
date, time, dataetime, year    is enough for date and time

  int datatype
  create table xyz(a int);
  
  insert into xyz values(9);
  if we do some thing like this
  insert into xyz values('Vikrant');
   It will show error , if we input 1.5 it will not give error but save it as 2rounding it off to 2.
   
   drop table xyz;
   
   create table xyz(a double);
   insert into xyz values(9);
   it will be accepted, if you insert 1.5 it will accept it as it is
   
   drop table xyz;
   
   create table xyz(a boolean);
   
   insert into xyz values(9);  it gets accepted  as non zero is true 
                                                             
    insert into xyz values(True);    will save 1    
      
    insert into xyz values(False);    will save 0
      
    varchar
    
    create table xyz (a varchar(15));
    
    insert into xyz values('Arun');
    it will be accepted as size is less than 15
    if we try to insert data more than 15 length it will show an error.
    
    create table xyz(a date);  format is 'yyyy-mm-dd'
    
    insert into xyz values('1992-12-03');
