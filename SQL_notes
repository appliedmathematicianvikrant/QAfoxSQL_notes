-- What is a databse
# it is a place where we can store and the data from.
# we can enter te data into databse.alter
# what is databse managemet system:
#  it is a software which is used to access the data in our databse.
# example of DBMS from our market MangoDB, Cassandra etc
# What is Data model?
# It defines how the data is stored insde a database.
# DBMS softwares can use nay of the model like
# 1. Hierarchcical    Parent child type of relationship
# 2.Network model    one child can have more than one parent
# 3.Entity relational model  one entity has many atrinutes.
# 4.relational model  it uses tables 

 
#Part 3

#SELECT Command in SQL
#It is used o retrieve the data from the table.
#Syntax:  select * from table_name;
# means all columns from the given table _name
# Now if we do not want all columns 
#  Use syntax:
 # SELECT column1, column2
# from table_name;

# Part 4

#To retrive unique values from particular column
# SELECT DISTINCT  column_name
# FROM table_name;
#
# if we  use distinct keyword before more than on columns then 
# if there are same value in fitst column but corresponding theynhave different va;ues
# in second column then these same values will be displayed

#part 5

# sql is not case sensitive langauge
# All clauses can be written in upper or lower or in mixed alphabets.

# part 6
# importance of semicolon " ; "
# select * from customers;  we eend the satement with semicolon 
# is it mandatory . Only in some RDBMS software it is mandatory
# in Mysql it is optional.
#  
# What is the purpose of semicolon?
#  we want to excutes more than one statment so the semicolon indicates that now we have end of
# a query.It seperators multiple sql statements.

# part 7     WHERE clause
# used in select statement
# we will be able to filter some data based on some condition
# Example:
# select * from customers where city='London';
#  as country name is text we have used single quotes
#  Numbers are not surrounded by single quotes.
# Here we have used the '=' operators but we can use other operators also.

#part 8  Relational operators in WHERE clause
 
#  We ecan use the following relational opeartors
#  =  equal opeator
#  > greater than opeator
#  < less than operator
#  >=  greater than or equal to opeator 
# <= less than or equal to operator
# <>  or !=  not equal to
# Example : select * from orders where price <= 40;

# part 9   logical operators
# used with WHERE clause conditions
#                      Withot logical opeators                  with logical operators   AND, OR, NOT
#         filter the data Only one condition is taken                 more than one condition can be taken to flter the data 
#                                                                 select * from table_name where condition1 AND condition2..
#   Example to use NOT 
# select * from table_name where NOT city='Germany';   NOT do reverse filteration.

# part 10

# part 17 breaking lengthy sql queries  into multiple lines

# When SQL stataemnty is loengthy then reading such statements will become hard 
# select customerID, customerName, country, city  from customers  where country='France' limit 3;
# it is not easy to understand this statement
# write it as
# select customerID, customerName, country, city  
# from customers 
# where country='France'
# limit 3;

# part 18  Built in functions and there categories

# Different RDBMS softwares 
# MySQL, Oracle,  different RDBMS softwares has there own list of built in functions
# we are using built in functions of MySQL
# just go to google.com and search for MySQL functions
# Types of builts in functions
# 1. DAte and Time function
# 2. string function
# 3. Aggregate fujnction
# 4.numeric function

# part 19   UPPER()  string function

#Purpose: To convert the text under the table column to upper case
# select 'Arun Motori'    its output is Arun Motori
# But if we apply UPPER function
# select UPPER('Arun Motori');  output is   ARUN MOTORI
# select UPPER(column_name) from tanle_name;  will give all column data in capitals.
#

# part 20  LOWER() string function

# Purpose: to convert the text under the column name to lower case
# select 'Arun Motori'    its output is   Arun Motori
# if we apply lower function  
# select LOWER('Arun Motori');    Its output is   arun motori
# select LOWER(column_name) AS countryfrom table_name;  will give all column data in lower case.
# if we do not use alias then the column will be shown as LOWER(column_name)  whiuch does not looks good
#
                                  part 21  length() string function
purpose: find the length/size of the data under the specified column name
we can also apply this function on some string
select length('Arun motori');     remember that a space is alos counted as one
select length(column_name) as our_choose_name from table_name;

we can also use this function with WHERE clause  exampel WHERE length(column_name) = 6

                                  part 22   INSTR() string function  
purpose: to find the positoin of gievn text in the data of the specified column
INSTR(column_name, 'u')

it can also be used without columns
select instr('Vikrant', 'a');   output: 5
it is better to use some alias 
if some string is not present the  the outout is 0
